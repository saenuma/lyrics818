How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul

0:37
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

0:53
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)

1:05
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

1:15
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

1:38
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)

1:51
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

1:59
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

2:18
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

2:38
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems

2:46
I've got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here

2:56
There must be something wrong, bring me to life

2:58
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)

3:12
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

3:20
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life
